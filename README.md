# cubicexplorer
An extremely customizable Windows file manager

=== Project Goals
This is an attempt by a non-developer to find someone to take over for the oustanding and irreplacable CubicExplorer program.

=== Ownership
The code is copyright the original developer Marko Savolainen (cubicreality@gmail.com) and is being hosted on Github as I can't find the source over on SourceForge (https://sourceforge.net/p/cubicexplorer/code/HEAD/tree/) or Google Code (https://code.google.com/archive/p/cubicexplorer/source)

=== Links

The original home page is offline and I'm not sure of the status of the developer.  Both the program, the old home page, and old source code listing can be found thanks to the good work of archive.org:

A portable edition is also available from PortableApps.com, though I much prefer the developer's portable version.
