# cubicexplorer
Extremely customizable Windows file manager

This is an attempt by a non-developer to find someone to take over for the oustanding and irreplacable CubicExplorer program.

The code is copyright the original developer Marko Savolainen (cubicreality@gmail.com) and is being hosted on Github as I can't find the source over on SourceForge (https://sourceforge.net/p/cubicexplorer/code/HEAD/tree/) or Google Code (https://code.google.com/archive/p/cubicexplorer/source)

The original home page is offline and I'm not sure of the status of the developer.
